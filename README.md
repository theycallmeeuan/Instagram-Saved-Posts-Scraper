# Instagram-Saved-Posts-Scraper

This is a small scraping tool i created for an internship i was working at!

I was tasked with extracting the details (caption, post url, picture, account username) of an instagram post for posting in a telegram channel, and this is the code i came up with for them. This was coded entirely in python.
